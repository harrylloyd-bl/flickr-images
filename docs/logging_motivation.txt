Background
The BL has 1m+ images on Flickr. ~90% of these have machine tags generated by a neural network called SherlockNet created by Stanford uni students as part of a BL Labs competition in 2016. Tagged images have sherlocknet:category tags (1 per image) and sherlocknet:tag tags (many per image). These tags are rarely accurate and occasionally offensive, so we need to remove them.

There's an entry on the research repository for the project (https://bl.iro.bl.uk/concern/datasets/3205f8c5-f7dd-46fa-8bf4-9ac72f6fbb55). This contains 970204 sherlocknet:category tags and 13894196 sherlocknet:tag tags. According to the Flickr API machine tag endpoints there are ~960000 sherlocknet:category tags and ~13m sherlocknet:tag tags.

Task
Iterate through all BL images on Flickr, if sherlocknet tags exist check for them in the research repository material, save any tags that aren't represented then remove all Sherlocknet tags from the image.

Logging motivation
- Ensure any tags that have been removed could be reinstated if needed
- Track progress of tag removal so multiple instances of the code can work through BL images at once (to avoid this taking forever)

Logging
Flickr tags have 3 attributes: 
id	The unique id for this tag on this photo.
author	The NSID of the user who added the tag.
raw	The 'raw' version of the tag - as entered by the user. This version can contain spaces and punctuation.

If removing a tag the log should capture all 3 attributes with the photo id

The code iterates through all 1m images as returned by the user.getPhotos endpoint. The log should capture a list of images that the code has iterated through, not assuming that this list will be sequential (i.e. multiple processes running through different parts of the 1m images could write to the same log).
