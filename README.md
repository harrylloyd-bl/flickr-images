Flickr Images
==============================

Working with the Flickr API using the flickr-api Python package.

### Removing Sherlocknet Tags
The BL has 1m+ images on Flickr. ~90% of these have machine tags generated by a neural network called SherlockNet created by Stanford uni students as part of a BL Labs competition in 2016.
Tagged images have sherlocknet:category tags (1 per image) and sherlocknet:tag tags (many per image). These tags are rarely accurate and occasionally offensive, so we need to remove them.

Removing these tags is done by iterating through the user.getPhotos endpoint on the Flickr API, checking for Sherlocknet tags, seeing if they're reflected in the existing Research Repository
entry for Sherlocknet and saving them if not, then deleting the tags.

### Tag generation
Using computer vision methods to generate new tags.

### Hack & Yack
This repo also contains branches used in the December 2023 Hack & Yack dedicated to exploring ways of using our Flickr images.
